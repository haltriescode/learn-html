                    Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It's a digital form of money that operates without a central authority, like a bank. Transactions are verified and recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. Bitcoin is often used as a store of value, like digital gold, and can also be used for online payments.

                    Ethereum is more than just digital money. It’s a platform where developers can create decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts—programs that run automatically when conditions are met. Think of it as a programmable version of Bitcoin. Its currency, Ether (ETH), is used to power these applications and pay for transactions on the Ethereum network.
